## Documentation: Running `issues_daily.py` Locally

This script fetches open GitHub issues from Python and JavaScript repositories, filters them by specific labels, and saves the results in a Markdown file within an `issues/` directory. It also commits and pushes the results to your repository if configured to do so.

### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can verify by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   
2. **GitHub Personal Access Token**: You’ll need a GitHub token with permissions to read repository information and push changes. You can generate one by going to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

3. **Git**: Ensure Git is installed on your system and is configured to push changes to your repository if you plan to commit results.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing `issues_daily.py` to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Open the `.env` file and add your GitHub token:

   ```env
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   ```

   Replace `your_github_token_here` with your actual GitHub token.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip`. It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

1. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If a `requirements.txt` file isn’t available, install the required packages manually:
   ```bash
   pip install requests python-dotenv
   ```

### Step 4: Run the Script

To run the script and fetch GitHub issues, execute the following command:

```bash
python issues_daily.py
```

### Step 5: Verify Output

After running, you should see:
- An `issues/` directory created in the project folder (if it doesn’t already exist).
- A new Markdown file in `issues/` with a timestamped filename (e.g., `issues_2024-10-01_12-00-00.md`), containing the list of issues fetched from GitHub.

### Step 6: Push Changes (Optional)

If you want to push the generated file to GitHub, ensure your Git configuration allows pushing to the repository. Run the following commands:

```bash
git add issues/
git commit -m "Add issues file generated by issues_daily.py"
git push
```

### Additional Notes

- **Customizing Filters**: You can modify the labels, languages, and date filters in the script by updating the `LABELS`, `LANGUAGES`, and `CREATED_AFTER` variables.
- **Running Periodically**: To run this script automatically, consider using a cron job or GitHub Actions for scheduled execution.

This setup should allow you to successfully run `issues_daily.py` locally, manage dependencies, and optionally push results back to your GitHub repository.
